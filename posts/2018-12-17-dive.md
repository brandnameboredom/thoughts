I heard about this tool the other day while watching the [Kelsey Hightower keynote from KubeCon/CloudNativeCon] called [dive] and decided to play around with it myself.  Spoiler alert...it is pretty nice

So. What is dive?

Dive provides insight into the layers of your docker image for size optimization purposes.  Through the UI you can quickly discover what was introduced/changed in each layer and iterate on the image via a ```dive build -t image-tag .``` which leads to a much quicker build/analyze image optimization/development cycle.  Also, there is a nifty feature which will provide some rough estimate of how efficient the analyzed image is in terms of space savings so it adds a bit of gamification to the mundane task of image optimization.

Anyway, [check it out]!
