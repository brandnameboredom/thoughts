I was doing some research on [buildah] recently and decided to try to play around with a simple speedtest app we had on hand.  This app is a fork of [this repository] on GitHub and does exactly what you would expect.  So, since we already had a Dockerfile defined for the app I decided to utilize the ```bud``` capability within buildah to ```build using dockerfile (bud)```.  

```buildah bud -f Dockerfile -t test .```

I didn't have to specify ```-f Dockerfile``` because the ```bud``` capability defaults to ```Dockerfile``` but whatever.  Once the image was build from the Dockerfile and tagged with the "test" label I was ready to grab a reference to the container and execute my python command.

```test_var=$(buildah from test)```

Now that ```test_var``` has my reference, I can tell buildah to run it with whatever command I would like.

```buildah run $test_var python -m flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5000```

Bingo.  Speedtest is now running and I can hit the site at ```localhost:5000```.  I did notice though that a call to ```buildah images``` as compared to ```docker images``` reveals that the buildah generated image is slightly larger than the one generated using the ```docker build``` command.  Hmmm...interesting...
