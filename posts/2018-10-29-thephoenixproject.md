We've recently had a consultant from RedHat on site helping to get our on-prem solution stood up.  One day, while at lunch, he suggested a colleague and I pick up a copy of "The Phoenix Project" by Gene Kim, Kevin Behr, and George Spafford.  I was shocked how eerily familiar many of the characters portrayed in the book felt while reading.  If you have the time, and honestly even if you don't, pick up a copy for yourself.  Here is a sample from the book available for purchase on amazon in your preferred format.
