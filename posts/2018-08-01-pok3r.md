### Today I received my first _real_ keyboard in the mail.  

Introducing the [Pok3r by Vortex].

For years now I've been using whatever keyboard/mouse combo I could get my hands on.  That is until a friend of mine at work let me try out his Pok3r Vortex 60% mechanical keyboard for a week.  At first I was a little unsure I would like the 60% reduction and removal of my treasured [arrow keys].

After about 5 minutes however I was hooked.  The arrow keys on the Pok3r are mapped to the I, J, K, and L keys and the Caps Lock key can be programmed via a switch on the bottom to act as a function key.  So, hold caps lock and navigate around using these mapped keys.  Never move your hands from the home key row.  Beautiful.

So, when the keyboard dropped on [Massdrop] it was a done deal.

Bonus, I picked up the RGB version.  Here is a closer picture of the keyboard rocking a solid blue backlight.

So, do yourself a favor.  Take a look down at your keyboard.  If it isn't a nice mechanical keyboard you truly enjoy typing on...you're doing it wrong.
