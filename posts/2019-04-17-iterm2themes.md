I'm still new to MacOS but I'm really enjoying [iTerm2].  I highly recommend you stop here and go get it if you don't have it installed already.  No, seriously...
```brew cask install iterm2```
Now that you have iTerm2, I suggest you go grab the [powerlevel9k] or [spaceship] theme asap.  Good stuff.  Check out the links for more information.
