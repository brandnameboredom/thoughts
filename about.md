# Hello.  I'm Brad.

I write code.  I write code for my job.  I write code for my own entertainment.  I write code for family members.  I write code for fun.  When I'm not behind a keyboard, I'm usually watching one of my favorite sports teams or peacefully fishing from a kayak.

My hopes for this space is to write about topics I find interesting in the world of software development.  Ready. Go.

Oh, and this site is <a href="{{ site.source_link }}">open source</a> if you want to check it out.
